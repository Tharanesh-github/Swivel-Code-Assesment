## Introduction

I'm Tharanesh Vigneshwaran, an undergraduate student from the Informatics Institute Of Technology and I'm thankful for the opportunity provided by [Swivel](https://www.swiveltech.io/). I have completed the assignment of creating a text to XML converter using Java.

## Getting Started
